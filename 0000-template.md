# Summary

One paragraph explanation of the activity or project.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted,
the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions. In other words,
enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too
closely to the solution you have in mind.

# Details

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the activity or the project in enough detail 
for somebody to be able to imagine:
- how to join it as a co-organizer
- how to join it as a participant

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider the impact on the current community 
members, if any. Also consider the impact on other ongoing projects.

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

# Alternatives

What other approaches have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts are still TBD?
