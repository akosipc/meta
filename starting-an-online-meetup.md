# Summary

Online monthly meetups to temporarily replace the normal face-to-face meetups.

# Motivation
## Why are we doing this?

We haven't had a meetup recently and it is a concerning matter for me. Also, this pandemic decreases the chances that we can organize face-to-face meetups. I believe we should take the opportunity to organize an online meetup for Ruby developers. 

## What use cases does it support?

This suggestion can be applied during the pandemic and even post-pandemic. 

## What is the expected outcome?
- Bring back monthly or bi-monthly Ruby meetups. 
- Increase awareness of Ruby developers in the Philippines.
- Encourage new developers to take on the mantle of handling community related tasks.
- Share our knowledge to new Ruby developers.

# Details
## How to join as a Co-Organizer
Let the community managers know. There's a lot of tasks invovled in organizing the meetups and we should delegate this tasks often. 

As an organizer, it is your job to make sure that the meetup goes smoothly. With the proposed setup, we will be subjected to the whims of the internet connection in the Philippines so it is best if we have multiple host during one meetup. Organizers must be ready in case there are no speakers available to give a presentation. 

Hopefully, we can start by January or February 2021.

To sum it up:
- 2 or more hosts for the online meetup
- The organizers will be handling the transition from topic => questions segments
- The organizers must encourage participants to share their knowledge in Ruby in future meetups.

## How to join as a Speaker
Again, let the community managers know or submit a proposal in the #ruby phackers.slack.com channel. Any topic should be fine as long as it is somewhat Ruby related. Topics from previous meetups can be repeated and shouldn't be discouraged. 

We'll ask the speakers to pre-record their talk into an acceptable video format and submit it to the organizers 1 week before the meetup starts. If the speaker wasn't able to submit their video, their topic will be moved into the next meetup. Videos can be uploaded to Google Drive, Youtube, Vimeo or whatever platform you choose as long as it is accessible.

## How to join as a Participant
Join, participate and ask questions in the meetup. There are no dumb questions during the meetup. We highly encourage participants to start sharing their experiences in Ruby as well.

# Drawbacks

This will require constant attention from the community. We'll need to organize these details first before proceeding:
- How many speakers for the meetup?
  - We'll need to schedule these in advance
- Marketing posts in Facebook, Phackers and Discord servers

# Alternatives

Right now, there are no alternatives considered.
